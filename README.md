# Neural Network Project: Art Style Transfer

The algorithm of this project will realize Neural Style Transfer. 

By using neural network, this algorithm can extrat the style of an art masterpiece, for example "The Starry Night" of Vincent van Gogh:

![the starry night](/image/style.jpg)

Then merge the style with your own photo.

Here is the original photo:

And then, the photo after art style transfer:

The algorithm is base on the vgg pretrained model which can be download from:http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat

This algorithm was created by Gatys et al. (2015) https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576
